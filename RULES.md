## Magic

Players who are playing their _first game_ of Grasshopper all start with two magic spells. These spells may be called at any time while the player is the kickbatter, after the ball is kicked, and before they are out.

When players wake up the next morning, whomever has the highest score has only _one_ magic spell, while the lowest-scoring player has _three_ magic spells.

### Magic spells

The following magic incantations can be cast at any point during play by the kickbatter:

- **Beetlejuice, beetlejuice, beetlejuice, [other player's name]** - After calling "Beetlejuice" thrice, the kickbatter names an opponent. That opponent then tries their hardest to _prevent_ a ball or frisbee from reaching a tripod. The "juiced" player may knock down balls, slap frisbees, or otherwise confuse the other players, but may not kick the ball or throw the frisbee.
- **Grapevine** - All players who are not the kickbatter may only move by doing a grapevine dance (passing the feet side to side, one in front of the other)
- **Multiball** - The kickbatter, upon reaching the opposite tripod, can pick up the extra soccer ball and kick it in any direction. That ball is now required to reach the same tripod as the main soccer ball and frisbee before the batter is considered out.
